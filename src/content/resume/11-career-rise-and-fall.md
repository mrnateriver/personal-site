The Peak of the career and the following descend into the Valley of Despair, according to Dunning and Kruger. Had to build a whole multi-million company's IT presence, starting from a RESTish backend and client websites with supporting infrastructure, and then a backoffice with real-time collaboration, daemon utilities, internal tools, Webpack plugins, cross-platform smartphone application, ETL with business analytics and more. Even published a few minor OSS NPM packages. Got first experience leading a technical team.
